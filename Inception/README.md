Important points 

1. we have the first two .js files in script tags one for react core functionalites and another for DOM
2. we have id = root a div element in the index.html
3. we can create React Elements using Root.CreateElement
4. The code also shows the nested child elements creation
5. root.render(element) - this renders the element to the root div

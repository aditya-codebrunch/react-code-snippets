Below is My notes

● What is JSX?

JSX is a html or xml like syntax. It is not html. JSX is different and React is different. JSX is not a valid javascript. It is transpiled into javascript by babel. Babel converts it into React.createElement.
JSX stands for javascript xml.

● Superpowers of JSX

JSX makes life easy for developers. Without it we need to use "React.createElement" and define the elements and it is not easy.

within JSX using {} this we can run javascript. JSX sanitises what goes into {} and thus prevents cross-site-scripting attack.

● Role of type attribute in script tag? What options can I use there?

It tells about the type of the script.
If there is no 'type' then it is a normal javascript file and if we use type = 'module' then it is javascript module.

● {TitleComponent()} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs
{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX

All these three can be used and they return the jsx returned by the component.
